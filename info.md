** Creates Google Fit sensors.
At the moment, provides following measurements:
    - steps
    - distance
    - time
    - calories
    - weight
    - height
    - sleep
    - heartrate

Sensor is designed to be flexible and allow customization to add new Google Fit
dimensions with minimal effort with relative knowledge of Python and Fitness
Rest API.

In order to add this component as is, add a new sensor:

sensor:
  - platform: google_fit
    name: Google Fit
    client_id: your_client_id
    client_secret: your_client_secret

In order to generate your client_id and client_secret, see the prerequisites
for Google Calender component:
https://www.home-assistant.io/components/calendar.google/#prerequisites

To make sensor work you have to enable Fintness API in your project.
In oder to enable Fitness API open Google cloud console: 
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/fitness.googleapis.com
and enable API.

It is recommendable to store client_id and client_secret as secret as
possible. You can read about it on:
https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/secrets/

Example:
  - platform: google_fit
    name: Bob
    client_id: !secret google_fit_client_id
    client_secret: !secret google_fit_client_secret
